### About My

I have spent the last six years developing my skills as a Civil engineer. But now I have discovered a more interesting profession for myself - Web Development. Day by day, after the main work, I practice and study the theory of web programming. Almost all of my free time is spent on "lines of code" and online simulators. I think that my diligence and hard work will help me become exactly the developer you need.
